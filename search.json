25, 1963 formally amended that recommendation.\\nthe commission, having transmitted the recommendations to the contracting parties for their consideration, has now received notifications of acceptance of the recommendation relating to halibut and the recommendation, as amended, relating to herring, as follows: from japan on february 26, 1963, from the united states of america on march 23, 1963, and

pollution liability and compensation system,\\nnoting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 fund convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some contracting states to that convention,\\nrecognizing that a number of contracting states to the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which states may accede if they so wish,\\nbelieving that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim,\\nconsidering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to contracting states to

the west coast of the queen charlotte islands and that the halibut stock of the eastern bering sea no longer meet the conditions of article iv of the convention and adopted recommendations for the removal of such stocks of herring and halibut from the annex to the international convention for the high seas fisheries of the north pacific ocean. it was subsequently noted that some ambiguity might arise from the language of the recommendation with respect to herring. therefore, the commission on january 25, 1963 formally amended that recommendation.\\nthe commission, having transmitted the recommendations to the contracting parties for their consideration, has now received notifications of acceptance of the recommendation relating to halibut and the recommendation, as amended, relating to herring, as follows: from japan on february 26, 1963, from the united states of america on march 23, 1963, and from canada on may 8, 1963.\\nin accordance with the provisions of article vii, paragraph 1, of the convention, sections (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of the annex are considered amended from may 8, 1963 to read in the english language as follows:\\n\\\"(a) halibut (hippoglossus

establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992\\nsource: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/notinforce/2005/21.html\\nthe contracting states to the present protocol,\\nbearing in mind the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter \\\"the 1992 liability convention\\\"),\\nhaving considered the international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter \\\"the 1992 fund convention\\\"),\\naffirming the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,\\nnoting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 fund convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some contracting states to that convention,\\nrecognizing that a number of contracting states to the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which states may accede if they so wish,\\nbelieving that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim,\\nconsidering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to contracting states to the 1992 fund convention,\\nhave agreed as follows:\\ngeneral provisions\"

compensation for oil pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter \\\"the 1992 fund convention\\\"),\\naffirming the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,\\nnoting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 fund convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some contracting states to that convention,\\nrecognizing that a number of contracting states to the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which states may accede if they so wish,\\nbelieving that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim,\\nconsidering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to contracting states to the 1992 fund convention,\\nhave agreed as follows:\\ngeneral provisions\" #> [2] \"19\\nsignature, ratification, acceptance, approval and accession\\n1 this protocol shall be open for signature at london from 31

pollution damage, 1992 (hereinafter \\\"the 1992 fund convention\\\"),\\naffirming the importance of maintaining the viability of the international oil pollution liability and compensation system,\\nnoting that the maximum compensation afforded by the 1992 fund convention might be insufficient to meet compensation needs in certain circumstances in some contracting states to that convention,\\nrecognizing that a number of contracting states to the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions consider it necessary as a matter of urgency to make available additional funds for compensation through the creation of a supplementary scheme to which states may accede if they so wish,\\nbelieving that the supplementary scheme should seek to ensure that victims of oil pollution damage are compensated in full for their loss or damage and should also alleviate the difficulties faced by victims in cases where there is a risk that the amount of compensation available under the 1992 liability and 1992 fund conventions will be insufficient to pay established claims in full and that as a consequence the international oil pollution compensation fund, 1992, has decided provisionally that it will pay only a proportion of any established claim,\\nconsidering that accession to the supplementary scheme will be open only to contracting states to the 1992 fund convention,\\nhave agreed as follows:\\ngeneral provisions\"

meeting, at seattle, the international north pacific fisheries commission determined that the herring stocks off the west coast of the queen charlotte islands and that the halibut stock of the eastern bering sea no longer meet the conditions of article iv of the convention and adopted recommendations for the removal of such stocks of herring and halibut from the annex to the international convention for the high seas fisheries of the north pacific ocean. it was subsequently noted that some ambiguity might arise from the language of the recommendation with respect to herring. therefore, the commission on january 25, 1963 formally amended that recommendation.\\nthe commission, having transmitted the recommendations to the contracting parties for their consideration, has now received notifications of acceptance of the recommendation relating to halibut and the recommendation, as amended, relating to herring, as follows: from japan on february 26, 1963, from the united states of america on march 23, 1963, and from canada on may 8, 1963.\\nin accordance with the provisions of article vii, paragraph 1, of the convention, sections (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of the annex are considered amended from may 8, 1963 to read in the english language as follows:\\n\\\"(a) halibut (hippoglossus stenolepis)\\nthe convention area off the coast of canada and the united states of america, exclusive of the bering sea, in which commercial fishing for halibut is being or can be prosecuted. halibut referred to herein shall be those originating along the coast of north america.\\n\\\"(b) herring (clupea pallasii)\\nthe convention area off the coast of canada in which commercial fishing for herring of canadian origin is being or can be prosecuted, exclusive of the waters of the high seas north of 51°56' north latitude and west of the queen charlotte islands and west of a line drawn between langara point on langara island, queen charlotte islands, and cape muzon on dall island in southeast alaska.\\\"\\ncopies are attached to this letter of the amended section (a) in the japanese language, which i transmitted with my letter of december 6, 1962, and of the
