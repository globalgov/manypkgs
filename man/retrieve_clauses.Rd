\description{
The function splits treaty texts into lists that reflect a structure
based on having a preamble and several articles.
Once articles are split, users can access the "preambles",
"accession" and "termination" clauses, or "annexes"
within a collection of treaty texts.
The selection of each of these articles relies on regex matching
certain expressions unique to each of them.
Alternatively, users can get all the articles that contain a certain
'desired' word within a collection of treaty texts.
As well, users can select only certain types of treaties for which
specific articles are to be returned (e.g. agreements).
}
\details{
Please make sure treaty texts have been standardised first
using \code{standardise_texts()} for best results.
