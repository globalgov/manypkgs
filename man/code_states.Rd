\usage{
code_states(title, activity = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{A character vector of treaty titles}

\item{activity}{Do you want the activity of treaty to be coded?
By default, TRUE.}
}
\value{
A character vector of parties
that are mentioned in the treaty title
}
\description{
Identify the countries that are part of an agreement.
}
\details{
The function codes states in treaty titles.
The function also returns the "activity" for bilateral treaties coded,
if activity is TRUE.
Bilateral agreements usually detail their activity and specify area in the
last words of the titles.
These last words are abbreviated by the function to differentiate between
bilateral treaties and avoid false positives being generated since multiple,
different, bileteral treaties are often signed in the same day.
For the complete list of parties coded please run the function without
an argument (i.e. \code{code_states()}).
